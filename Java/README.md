Task
Given an integer `x`, perform the following conditional actions:

Verify that `x` is between `1` and `100`.

- If `x` is odd, print Weird
- If `x`is even and in the inclusive range of `2` to `5`, print Not Weird
- If `x` is even and in the inclusive range of `6` to `20` , print Weird
- If `x` is even and greater than `20`, print Not Weird

## Assignment 4

Given and integer `x`, print it's first 10 multiples.

Verify that `x` is between `2` and `20`.

Sample input

```
x = 2
```

Sample Output
```
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20
```
